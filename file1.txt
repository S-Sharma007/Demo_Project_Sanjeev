 this is the first project practice of the sanjeev and saurabh course
lets work as he instructed to get the deisred result. 
 I am getting confused as there is so much to learn , and i am slow in learning 
but i'm giving my almost say 7 hrs a day to the learning and i think this not the sufficient time. 
i neeed to work hard more to get my desire result. 



 wasting the days will not get me any were , I had to work very hard .
